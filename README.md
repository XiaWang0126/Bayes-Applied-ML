# Applied Machine Learning

## Module outline and aims

This module is designed to introduce you to machine learning and to give you some
practical experience of applying a range of machine learning techniques.
The lectures will be based around case studies which will be demonstrated in Python.
Coursework will require you to adapt and extend the code provided during the lectures
and to carry out a machine learning project from scratch.
The course is focused mainly on practical aspects of machine learning but some
relevant theory will be discussed. 

## Content outline

The first week will cover various options for setting up an environment in which to do
your work. Course content changes over time but previous years have included
Kaggle kernels, Google’s Colab and Docker. Software used (other than Python) is �
has been the sklearn package, H2O and vowpal wabbit – this can vary from year to
year. 

Content in the remaining weeks will cover some of the key high level concepts
applicable to many areas of machine learning and various models and types of
machine learning. These include:

• Loss functions

• Generalisation error

• Train, validation and test samples and the various types of validation

• Bias and variance

• Penalisation and regularisation

• Feature scaling

• Hyper-parameter tuning

A significant amount of time is spend discussing regression and penalised regression.
Overall, models and types of machine learning may include some of:

• Trees, random forests, gradient boosting and ensembles

• Penalised regression (ridge regression, the LASSO and elastic net) and
Generalised Additive Models

• Unsupervised learning including PCA

• Neural networks and deep learning

• Online learning (vowpal wabbit)
