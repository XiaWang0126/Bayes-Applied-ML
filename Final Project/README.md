# Group Assignment

For your assignment you are asked to first identify a dataset on Kaggle.com that is relevant to your
area of study interest. Check that the dataset has sufficient variables and data points to be useful for
analysis. Check the usability score to determine if Kaggle has ranked the dataset as sufficiently robust.
Your assignment then is to:

1. Clean the dataset, providing notation describing the choices made.
2. Apply your interpretation of at least one analysis from each of the module’s Classes 2-6 to the
dataset. There should be a table provided in the introduction which maps how the material
from each class has been mapped to the analysis provided in your report. If there is a particular
reason why the material from one of the Classes of the course cannot be carried out for your
dataset, then explain this in the Table. A focus should be on the accuracy obtained from your
machine learning code compared to naïve or baseline models.
3. Each of the analyses should consist of a set of code, the output, and an interpretation and
implications from your analysis.
